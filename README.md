## About
When you create rich internet applications you need an icon package.  
Of course, the most popular one is fatcow.

It is uncomfortable to copy icons from project to project and to keep them in repository for every project.  
Instead of doing monkey work it's better to use icon CDN for all your projects.

This projects helps to search icons, prepare data for use them and to serve icons to client.  
In addition, icons will be cached accross your projects and servers load will be reduced.

You can clone repository and make your own icon hosting or use existing one.
